# schoolAdminProject

Hi this is an ASP.Net website that I've been working on as a learning project. The website is supposed to simulate a school administration website wherein the administrator can alter and manipulate daat for the school. The repository should have two projects, the schoolAdminProj that houses the controllers, views, and Identity folders, and the schoolData project that is essentially a class library that houses the models and classes that work directly with the SQL database.
